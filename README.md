# `mingw-w64-git`
This repo is a `PKGBUILD` for [`git-for-windows`](https://github.com/git-for-windows/).
There's already one in the [official repo](https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/tree/main/mingw-w64-git),
but it uses the old Makefile build system and is complicated to port to multiple toolchains in msys2.

## Build system
This repo uses the new CMake build system to build the git binaries.
The Makefile build system is still used to build the docs and some other tools.

## Patches
I add some patches for multiple proposes.

1. 32-bit build and clang builds need some changes.
2. The version generated by `CMakeLists.txt` is wrong. I also add a custom postfix.
3. `CMakeLists.txt` lacks pcre2 support. Tracking: [git/git#1267](https://github.com/git/git/pull/1267)
4. `headless-git` should also be installed.
5. Remove `UNICODE` definitions. Tracking: [git/git#1269](https://github.com/git/git/pull/1269)
6. Fix shebang parsing. Tracking: [git-for-windows/git#3869](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/3869)

# `mingw-w64-git-credential-manager`
It doesn't build from source, because .NET SDK is not part of MSYS2.

# `mingw-w64-git-extras`
They are just a series of scripts for `git`.

# `mingw-w64-git-lfs`
It is newer than the one in the [official repo](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-git-lfs).

# `mingw-w64-git-sizer`
It builds from source, and installs to `libexec/git-core`.

# Usage
Note that some packages should be built before `mingw-w64-git` is installed,
because two `git` will confuse each other.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Berrysoft/msys-git-for-windows.git
$ cd msys-git-for-windows
$ # cd to the package folder...
$ makepkg-mingw -sifC
```
